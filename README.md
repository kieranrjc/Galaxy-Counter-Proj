# Galaxy-Counter-Proj
Project code for Masters' project, analyzing galactic environments.

Note: A lot of this code is rather untidy due to the time constraints placed upon 
the project, and getting things to work such as multiprocessing and corrections 
due to differences in mask files. Attempting to run this is not advised.
